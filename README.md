# Team Profile Generator
### The following is a commnad line application built using Node.js, it takes in some quick info on the members of a software engineering teeam and quickly generates a profile for each of its member. The user will first be prompted information to quickly generate a summary for the team manager, and then the rest of the team will follow through.

## Code Snippets
The following snippet appears to be nothing special without context, but it is a sign of my growth from learning more on how to utilize the Inquirer prompt. Compared to what I've done for the README generator, I've decided to research and learn a variety of different ways I can phrase my prompts for the user, and make it work.
```java
const add_Employee = () =>{
    return inquirer.prompt([
        {
            type: 'confirm',
            name: 'AddEmployee',
            message: 'Would you like to add another member?',
            default: false
        }
    ]).then((response)=>{
```
